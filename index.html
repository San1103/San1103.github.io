      <h3>Wasil Hassan</h3>
      <p>Hi, my name is Wasil Hassan, I am a first year student in Computer Science. When I joined the university in October, I have had prior experiences with programming so it was pretty straightforward as I had studied Computer Science during Sixth form as well as in Secondary School. I've always liked to program for personal enjoyment. The first week wasn't overwhelming however I did learn of new concepts of programming over the duration of bootcamp.
As for my hobbies, I enjoy playing Video Games and Football. I also love to watch TV Shows, Anime and movies.</p>

    <h3>Java Project</h3>
    <p>
	As for my Java Project, I decided to build a 2D Platformer which took some inspiration from games such as Mario. There are multiple levels, each having its own unique theme with different Backgrounds and platform types. There are also enemies in the game which try to halt your progress throughout as well as other Objects which will kill the player. The player also has a laser-eyes as a projectile to damage Objects/Enemies. Most levels require parkour around the map, which could be quite challenging.

      Here is a video which demonstrates the Gameplay aspects of the game: <a href="https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/7c9f6443-d581-424c-a9ef-134d54660915">https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/7c9f6443-d581-424c-a9ef-134d54660915</a>
